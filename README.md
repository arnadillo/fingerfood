In our final design for finger food you are able to add individual items to your order, clear your order, view your order at any time/view the customizations made to individual, navigate to any menu using the menu button, and submit your current order to the restaurant. 

All of the data is managed by the application the only data the user needs to enter is their thoughts of what they want to eat. The user will browse the menus and select items and add them to the order. 

******EXAMPLE******

From the main screen the user selects "burgers", they are taken to the burger list screen, here they select the "simple Simon". The user is now on the customization screen and they select bacon, cheese, ketchup, lettuce, and tomatoes. The user now presses "add to order". The user selects menu and is taken to the main menu screen, the user now selects the "boppity pop", they are taken to the drink customization screen. On the customization screen they select a medium size and make sure ice is checked off before pressing add to order. The user is finished and would like to check out, they select My Total and now have a view of their receipt. They review their order, are satisfied and select "send order", the user is definitely sure they want to eat and they select FEED ME!. They are given an order id which they are expected to take to the nearest cashier and our interaction with them is done.
